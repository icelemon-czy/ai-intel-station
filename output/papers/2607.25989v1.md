## Abstract

The vision of self-driving networks that monitor, reason, and act upon themselves with minimal human intervention relies on tightly coupled monitoring, analytics, and actuation functions. In this work, we treat these functions as three operational macro-intents: continuous telemetry, real-time analytics, and programmatic actuation, and formalize the health of each function as an intent that the network must continuously satisfy. A critical, yet underexplored, challenge stems from the causal coupling among these intents, where a singular fault within one macro-intent propagates as a co-drift and subsequently triggers cascading, symptomatic anomalies across the remaining intents. This ambiguity makes it exceedingly difficult for existing, reactive approaches to distinguish the true root-cause intent from symptomatic victim intents, and their reliance on threshold-crossing detection leaves insufficient time for proactive remediation. We introduce MILD, a novel framework that reformulates intent assurance from reactive drift detection to proactive failure prediction. Grounded in our three-macro-intent formulation of the self-driving control loop, MILD employs a teacher-augmented Mixture-of-Experts architecture with a hybrid objective that jointly optimizes intent failure prediction and root-cause attribution. MILD enables KPI-level diagnostics via SHAP explainability and dynamic intent failure urgency estimation via multi-horizon modeling. Our extensive evaluation of MILD across three environments of increasing realism, from a controlled statistical benchmark, to a microservices application, to an SDN-based edge-to-cloud testbed, demonstrates that MILD achieves high failure detection rates, strong remediation lead times, and accurate intent-level root-cause disambiguation. This positions MILD as a practical enabler of closed-loop assurance in next-generation autonomous networks.
